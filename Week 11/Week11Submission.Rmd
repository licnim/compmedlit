## Week 9

**Topic curated:** Factors affecting follower counts for K-pop
celebrities

I want to study how K-pop idols have made use of these restrictions to
create their usernames, and from that, how the designs of their
usernames might have affected their follower counts, alongside the
influence of external factors, like gender, age, and years in the
industry.

I will ultimately deduce what characteristics are more likely to attract
higher numbers of followers, and along with this data story create a web
app on Shiny that lets one create a fake idol profile with a few chosen
characteristics and generate an predicted amount of followers.

**Data sources:**

1.  "Kpop Idol Instagram Followers" retrieved from: [Faisal Amir on
    Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisalamir/kpop-idol-followers)
2.  News articles and other sources that help me categorise data - eg.
    in assessing the size of idols' company and how this affects data:
    [Who runs K-pop? Big Hit, backers of BTS, Kakao, label of IU, and CJ
    ENM, with Mnet music channel, loosen grip of 'Big Three' SM, JYP and
    YG](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/k-pop/news/article/3120731/who-runs-k-pop-big-hit-backers-bts-kakao-label-iu-and-cj-enm)

## Week 10

-   What does it take for a successful Instagram account in the K-pop
    industry?

-   K-pop might be one of the only music industries where one's
    Instagram page is almost as important as the music, being an
    important platform for fan communication, brand ambassadorship, and
    self-promotion. One's username, a handle that has to be searched to
    access an Instagram page, is therefore one of the most critical
    parts of an idol's persona and a significant determinant in the
    amount of fame and fans they have. Studying the patterns in idols'
    usernames, as well as other characteristics that can impact one's
    Instagram followers, is an critical part of social media management,
    another up-and-coming industry that, as Communications majors, we
    should keep our eyes on. Being able to decipher the factors behind
    something as volatile, unpredictable, but also as lucrative as
    social media fame is especially valuable information in the
    reputation economy that the world runs on today.

## Week 11

Answer the following questions,

(1) List the visualizations that you are going to use in your project
    (Answer: What are the variables that you are going to plot? How will
    it answer your larger question?),

(2) How do you plan to make it interactive? (Answer: features of
    ggplot2/shiny/markdown do you plan to use to make the story
    interactive)

(3) What concepts incorporated in your project were taught in the course
    and which ones were self-learnt? (Answer: Create a table with topics
    in one column and Weeks in the other to indicate which concept
    taught in which week is being used. Leave the entry of the Week
    column empty for self-learnt concepts)

(4) Visualisations will center around number of followers as an
    independent variable and a range of dependent variables. These
    variables include the characteristics of the username or the account
    holder. These will be largely plotted with box plots and scatter
    graphs. By extracting the trends from every dependent variable, we
    can get a better sense of which traits contribute to higher follower
    counts.

(5) I plan to make it interactive through a Shiny web app that applies
    the observations of the data analysed in the website to a game-like
    format where the user can choose different traits and come up with a
    username, all of which will be evaluated and a resultant number of
    followers generated. If possible, I would like to add a leaderboard
    for the number of followers generated.

## Week 9

**Topic curated:** Factors affecting follower counts for K-pop
celebrities

I want to study how K-pop idols have made use of these restrictions to
create their usernames, and from that, how the designs of their
usernames might have affected their follower counts, alongside the
influence of external factors, like gender, age, and years in the
industry.

I will ultimately deduce what characteristics are more likely to attract
higher numbers of followers, and along with this data story create a web
app on Shiny that lets one create a fake idol profile with a few chosen
characteristics and generate an predicted amount of followers.

**Data sources:**

1.  "Kpop Idol Instagram Followers" retrieved from: [Faisal Amir on
    Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisalamir/kpop-idol-followers)
2.  News articles and other sources that help me categorise data - eg.
    in assessing the size of idols' company and how this affects data:
    [Who runs K-pop? Big Hit, backers of BTS, Kakao, label of IU, and CJ
    ENM, with Mnet music channel, loosen grip of 'Big Three' SM, JYP and
    YG](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/k-pop/news/article/3120731/who-runs-k-pop-big-hit-backers-bts-kakao-label-iu-and-cj-enm)

## Week 10

-   What does it take for a successful Instagram account in the K-pop
    industry?

-   K-pop might be one of the only music industries where one's
    Instagram page is almost as important as the music, being an
    important platform for fan communication, brand ambassadorship, and
    self-promotion. One's username, a handle that has to be searched to
    access an Instagram page, is therefore one of the most critical
    parts of an idol's persona and a significant determinant in the
    amount of fame and fans they have. Studying the patterns in idols'
    usernames, as well as other characteristics that can impact one's
    Instagram followers, is an critical part of social media management,
    another up-and-coming industry that, as Communications majors, we
    should keep our eyes on. Being able to decipher the factors behind
    something as volatile, unpredictable, but also as lucrative as
    social media fame is especially valuable information in the
    reputation economy that the world runs on today.

## Week 11

Answer the following questions,

(1) List the visualizations that you are going to use in your project
    (Answer: What are the variables that you are going to plot? How will
    it answer your larger question?),

(2) How do you plan to make it interactive? (Answer: features of
    ggplot2/shiny/markdown do you plan to use to make the story
    interactive)

(3) What concepts incorporated in your project were taught in the course
    and which ones were self-learnt? (Answer: Create a table with topics
    in one column and Weeks in the other to indicate which concept
    taught in which week is being used. Leave the entry of the Week
    column empty for self-learnt concepts)

(4) Visualisations will center around number of followers as an
    independent variable and a range of dependent variables. These
    variables include the characteristics of the username or the account
    holder. These will be largely plotted with box plots and scatter
    graphs. By extracting the trends from every dependent variable, we
    can get a better sense of which traits contribute to higher follower
    counts.

(5) I plan to make it interactive through a Shiny web app that applies
    the observations of the data analysed in the website to a game-like
    format where the user can choose different traits and come up with a
    username, all of which will be evaluated and a resultant number of
    followers generated. If possible, I would like to add a leaderboard
    for the number of followers generated.

## Week 12

*Include the challenges and errors that you faced and how you overcame
them (if any)*

My errors can be divided into several types

1.  Data Processing
2.  Data Visualisation
3.  App Logic
4.  App Building

Data processing had the least amount of errors and challenges because
the data set I used was very complete and clean, which made it easy to
work with. There were some challenges in terms of making sure my string
matching processes (eg. matching the stage names and group names were
indeed included in the username) were complete and worked accurately for
different cases because many group names and stage names have
punctuations, spaces, or capitalisations that mean I cannot simply do a
str_count().

Data visualisation was also a fairly smooth process because much of my
visualisations are similar in terms of using box plot and I only have
one independent variable. I enjoyed the challenge of making the visuals
of my plot fit the webpage, like finding a suitable dark theme, ensuring
my margins, text, and colours were cohesive and readable, and making the
axes look good.

The challenges I faced in the app were more numerous, especially in the
logic and its features. Before this, I had not really experimented with
buttons, conditional and reactive text, and other interactive features,
so incorporating these took a lot of trial and error, especially in
understanding how user input (eg. a username) moves to become output on
the app's side (running the username through my function) and then is
output on their side (where their username is reflected as well as the
followers they obtain from my function). Ensuring the app would make
sense came with a few logical puzzles as well: for example, I have
slider ranges for "age" and "years active". If they were two regular
sliderInputs, i would likely run into the issue of being able to have
years active \> age. So, one challenge was making the "years active"
slider range dependent on "age", which I achieved through experimenting
with observeEvent and updateSliderInput.

I also faced a lot of errors in trying to incorporate some features that
I have since scrapped for now to focus on improve the existing features
of the app and put more time into improving the UI: this includes an
easily sharable imagemagick output of one's username, followers, and
other traits they input. The errors mostly came from being unable to
integrate the output with my function, leading to a unreachable
variables. I also wanted to make a leaderboard or a local record of
scores, but I will have to do more extensive research on how to deal
with the score data storage processes for that before I have anything
functional.

## Week 13

-   Answer the following questions,

    -   **(1)** What is the theme of your data story?

    -   **(2)** Why is it important to address this question?

    -   **(3)** Why do you think the data sources that you have curated
        can help you answer the question?

    -   **(4)** What are the insights from the data and how are they

The theme of my data story is: What are the factors affecting a K-pop
celebrity's Instagram followers?

It's important to address this question because it gives us some
quantifiable insights into what is otherwise seen as an unpredictable
and volatile field. The incorporation of social media into the
entertainment industry has become extremely profitable in recent years
with huge companies and brands getting on the sponsorship and ambassador
marketing bandwagon. To curate a suitable Instagram presence that makes
a celebrity attractive to receiving these deals is a valuable skill, and
the information I can extract from my data story can help greatly in
that endeavour.

The data source that I have curated gives me comprehensive information
about the Instagram profiles of a wide range of idols in the industry.

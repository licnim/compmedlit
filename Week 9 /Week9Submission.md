**Topic curated:** Factors affecting follower counts for K-pop celebrities

I want to study how K-pop idols have made use of these restrictions to create their usernames, and from that, how the designs of their usernames might have affected their follower counts, alongside the influence of external factors, like gender, age, and years in the industry.

I will ultimately deduce what characteristics are more likely to attract higher numbers of followers, and along with this data story create a web app on Shiny that lets one create a fake idol profile and generate an predicted amount of followers.

**Data sources:**

1.  "Kpop Idol Instagram Followers" retrieved from: [Faisal Amir on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisalamir/kpop-idol-followers)
2.  News articles and other sources that help me categorise data - eg. in assessing the size of idols' company and how this affects data: [Who runs K-pop? Big Hit, backers of BTS, Kakao, label of IU, and CJ ENM, with Mnet music channel, loosen grip of \'Big Three\' SM, JYP and YG](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/k-pop/news/article/3120731/who-runs-k-pop-big-hit-backers-bts-kakao-label-iu-and-cj-enm)
